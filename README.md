ROAD ACCIDENT

📖 Overview
This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize road accident data. The dashboard provides key insights into accident trends, severity levels, and contributing factors such as vehicle types, road conditions, and time periods. Its goal is to empower data-driven decision-making to improve road safety.

🔑 Key Features
Comprehensive Analysis:
Total Casualties: 417,883, categorized by severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight).
Casualty trends compared year-over-year (2021 vs. 2022).
Casualty Breakdown:
By vehicle type (cars, buses, trucks, etc.).
By road type (single carriageway, dual carriageway, etc.).
By light and surface conditions (daylight/dark, wet/dry/snow).
Visualized Trends:
Monthly casualty trends for better predictive analysis.
Comparative metrics across urban and rural areas.
Filter Panel: Dynamic filtering by time period, accident date, and location for granular analysis.

📊 Tools and Technologies
Microsoft Excel:
Pivot charts and slicers for interactive filtering.
Data cleaning and aggregation.
Data Visualization:
Use of bar charts, pie charts, and area charts for effective representation.
Custom color schemes and icons for enhanced readability.


🎯 Objectives
Identify patterns and trends in road accidents.
Provide actionable insights to reduce road fatalities and injuries.
Enhance road safety decision-making through data visualization.
🚀 Getting Started
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/road-accident-dashboard.git
Open the Road_Accident_Dashboard.xlsx file in Microsoft Excel.
Explore the dashboard and use slicers to analyze data dynamically.
📈 Insights Gained
Cars account for 79.8% of casualties, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.
309.7k casualties occurred on single carriageways, emphasizing infrastructure improvement needs.
Most accidents occur during daylight on wet roads, pointing to weather-related risk factors.
🛠️ Future Enhancements
Integration with real-time data for live updates.
Development of predictive models to forecast accident trends.
Porting the dashboard to Power BI or Tableau for extended capabilities.
